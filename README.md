# Project-Eyenput

### About:
  - This project is focussed on providing a software-based solution for Eye-tracking. Many differently-abled people are not able to use a Computer or play games on it. They also can't afford a costly hardware for the same. The Eyenput thus focuses particularly on a software solution.
  
### Workflow:
  - Filtering out the rest and tracking the Eyeball
  - Blink detection and counting
  - Head pose estimation
  - Personalization of the software according to a particular user
  
### Final codes:
  - Eyenput GUI.py (The GUI code)
  - eyenput_process.py (The back-end code)
  
### Progress:
  - Appliation interface designing
  - Dlib's 68 landmarks detector has been used to filter out the eyeball
  - Blink detection and counting
